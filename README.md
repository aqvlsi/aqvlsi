- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aqvlsi
-    About Me:
-    Iâ€™m passionate about Computer Architecture and VLSI Design projects. My current work involves performance simulations of RISC-V architecture using the Gem5 Simulator, OpenLane synthesis, Sky130, and qflow.

-    Iâ€™m currently working on Performance Simulations of RISC-V architecture, Gem5 SImulator, Openlane synthesis, Sky130 and qflow.
-    Current Projects:
-    Performance Simulations of RISC-V Architecture
-    Using the OpenLane toolchain for RTL to GDSII synthesis and implementing VLSI designs with the Sky130 PDK
-    Utilizing qflow for digital synthesis, placement, and routing of VLSI circuits.
-    riscv_simulations/: Contains scripts and configurations for RISC-V performance simulations using the Gem5 simulator.

  
-    Repository Structure:
riscv_simulations/: Contains scripts and configurations for RISC-V performance simulations using the Gem5 simulator.
openlane_synthesis/: Includes OpenLane project files, configuration scripts, and synthesis results.
sky130_designs/: Sky130 specific design files, PDK configurations, and layout designs.
qflow_projects/: qflow project files, synthesis scripts, and implementation results.
